This project focuses on predicting taxi fares in New York City. The dataset used includes information such as pickup and dropoff locations, timestamps, passenger counts, and fare amounts. The goa
l is to build a machine learning model that accurately estimates the fare for a taxi ride based on these features.

## Data Preprocessing
Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and erroneous entries.
Feature engineering to extract relevant information such as distance traveled, day of the week, time of day, etc.
## Model Development
Exploring various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
Tuning hyperparameters and evaluating models using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.
## Evaluation Metrics
Using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess the model's performance.
Visualizing model predictions against actual fare amounts to understand the model's accuracy and potential areas for improvement.
## Deployment
Deploying the best-performing model to make real-time fare predictions for new taxi rides.
Providing insights and recommendations for taxi fare estimation based on the model's findings.
This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem in the transportation domain, helping optimize taxi fare estimation and improve the overall user experience.
